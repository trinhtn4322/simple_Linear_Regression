# Linear Regression for Data House Pricing-Boston
- This is a small project of my review about Machine Learning
# 1. The project uses boston's data house pricing:
- ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 12. B: 1000(Bkâˆ’0.63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

# 2. In this project is divided into 4 steps:
+ Loading data
This data is stored in the library sklearn
So the data is loaded straight from the library
+ Data processing
Since the data is still raw, some simple processing needs to be done
+ Data visualization
Based on the corr values with the price variable we can draw some simple charts
+ Linear Regression
Using the built-in linear regression function of sklearn . library
